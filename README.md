# 🍷 EDA on Red Wine Quality Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Red Wine Quality dataset using Python. The goal is to understand dataset structure, identify important features, handle duplicates and missing values, and extract insights that influence wine quality.
